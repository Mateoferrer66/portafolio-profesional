## Project Overview

"Matius Store" is a full-featured e-commerce platform designed to sell digital and physical products ranging from premium software subscriptions to custom 3D printed executables. The goal was to build a scalable, secure, and user-friendly marketplace that integrates seamless payment processing and automated delivery systems.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Product Support**: Uniquely architected to handle both digital downloads (instant delivery via email) and physical goods (shipping logic and tracking).
- **Payment Integration**: Secure checkout flow integrated with local payment gateways (Wompi/Mercado Pago) for widely accepted payment methods.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Custom CMS for managing inventory, tracking orders in real-time, and generating sales reports.

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: Built with Astro for blazing fast static initial loads, hydrated with React components for dynamic cart management and checkout interactivity.
- **Performance**: Achieved a **98/100 Lighthouse score** by optimizing image delivery (WebP/AVIF) and minimizing main-thread JavaScript.
- **SEO Strategy**: Implemented structured data (Schema.org) for products, resulting in rich snippets in search results and a **30% increase** in organic traffic.

This project showcases my ability to deliver end-to-end commercial solutions that prioritize both user experience and business metrics.
