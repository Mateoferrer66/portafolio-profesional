## Overview

Frustrated by having ten different apps for my lightbulbs, plugs, and sensors, I built this unified dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Protocol Agnostic**: Supports Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Wi-Fi devices.
- **Local Control**: No cloud dependency; everything runs on a Raspberry Pi.
- **Automation Engine**: Node-based editor for creating complex rules.
- **Energy Monitoring**: Real-time vizualization of power consumption.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, D3.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, MQTT
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4, Zigbee2MQTT
